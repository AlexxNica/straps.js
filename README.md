## straps.js

Inheritance library with support for bean-style accessors and AOP patterns.

Copyright © 2006 - 2013, Jürg Lehni.

straps.js was created by extracting and simplifying the inheritance code from
boostrap.js, a JavaScript DOM library also published by Jürg Lehni:
https://github.com/lehni/bootstrap.js

The name was changed due to Twitter's introduction of their CSS framework with
the same name.

Documentation coming soon.
